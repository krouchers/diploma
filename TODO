☐ Make some validation for halfedge structure
    ☐ Vertex position is finite number
    ☐ Each halfedge's next point to unique halfedge
    ☐ Each halfedge is pointed to by a halfedge
    ☐ Check that each halfedge incident to a vertex, points to that vertex
    ☐ Check whether each halfedge incident to and edge, points to that edge
    ☐ Check wheterh each halfedge incident to a face, points to that face
